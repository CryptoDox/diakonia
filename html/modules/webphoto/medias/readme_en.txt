Read Me for webshow/media directory

To have webshow play a directory of media files, upload your media directory here.

** BE SURE TO INCLUDE A DUMMY INDEX.HTML TO PREVENT THE DISPLAY OF YOUR MEDIA DIRECTORY ** 

To show a logo/thumbnail image for each mp3 or flv file, name the gif, jpg, png file
 the same as the media file. ( song1.gif will display with song1.mp3 )

The module will read the file names in your directory and create an xspf playlist in the same order as they appear
 in your directory, so name your files in the alpha/numerical order you want them to play.


Use the admin panel to "Add Media" as a "directory" source and select the primary media type.
