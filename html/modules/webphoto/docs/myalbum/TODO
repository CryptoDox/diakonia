Feature Request

I would like to have some pattern editing features available for automatic modification of title / description. I use IrfanView for preparing my photos to publication. That program has a function of batch renaming. You can compose new name using patterns. I would like MyAlbum to allow creating new name using similar patterns like:

string PATTERN string

The patterns could be like:

### - successive number (of processed photos, with trailing zeros and numbering step as a parameter)

$ - previous text (title / description)

% - original filename
