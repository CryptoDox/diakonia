=================================================
Version: 0.90

when adding a new category.

2. Bug Fix
(1) In case of the module dupilication, the category list show the other module's data.

(3) Not show google marker in the neighborhood in submit form


* Update *
(1) When you unzip the zip file, there are two directories html and xoops_trust_path.
  Please copy and overwrite in the directory which XOOPS correspond
(2) Execute the module update in the admin cp.


* Notice for usage *
1. Read Permission  of category
The permission of the category acts independently with the parent category.
In general make the permission of the category the same as the parent category.

For example, 
when there is category B under category A,
you set the permisson of category A that the guest can not read 
and the permisson of category B that the guest can read,
the guest can read the items which belongs to category B.

2. Server load
The server load will be increased much,
when you use the read permisson of the category and the read permisson of the item.

I recommend to divide into more than one module
and to set permisson for each of the modules,
when there are many numbers of the categories and numbers of the items

The server load will be increased a bit ,
when you use the post premisson of the category and The download permission of the item.


* Notice *
Although there are no big problem, but I think that there are any small problem. 
Even if some problems come out, only those who can do somehow personally need to use.

Webphoto fix the directories belong the root directory.

Webphoto use the old files in photos just as it is.

But the phone cannot show other format video.

1.2 Path to temporary
this module preserves the received emails in this derectory.
It is not desirably that preserve emails in the accessible area by the WEB browsers such as the document route, because the email has personal information.
Recommend to set to this out of the document route.

the user cannot upload the large file.
This limitation is eased to use FTP.
On the other hand, with the FTP, the user can access XOOPS files.

Or, if the admin can add two or more FTP users,
operate by the setting which the user cannot access XOOPS files.
